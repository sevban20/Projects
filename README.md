## Fateining Farm Project
This is Arduino Nano-based project. It has 4 buttons to control menu operations. It can work in 2 modes: Automatic feed and cleaning bed of animals like cattle, sheep, etc., another mode is that manual feed and clean. It has 2 silos to store food. Every silo has its own motor that discharges food to the mixer. Mixer prepares food. After that, the conveyor starts feeding.
It has a cleaning unit to clean the ground. In addition, it has an RTC module to keep clock info. The RTC module is powered by a CR2032 battery. DHT22 sensor was used to measure humidity and temperature.To keep fresh air in the barn were used fans that control by temperature.The board has 2 power inputs, 5V, and 12V. 6 pieces of N-channel MOSFETs have been used to power the motors.
